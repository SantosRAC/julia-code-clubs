## Objectives

 * To gain literacy in coding for data analysis

## Rules

 * There must be a rotation in which every student have to prepare and present a code to the group
 * All students must read and try to understand what the code is doing to raise questions and provide feedback on week meetings
 * All code MUST be written in Portuguese; this will facilitate the inclusion of colleagues from Brazil (Portuguese speakers/ those whose native language is Portuguese)
 * Those attending the meetings regularly (every week) will have access to a folder on Google Drive (with books, tutorials, and additional material used o gain more coding literacy) and will be collaborators in the Github repository (permission to edit).

## Topics that have already been covered

 * Variables
 * Numerical operations
 * Conditional statements
